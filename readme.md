See my [favorite/popular/frequently asked](https://github.com/caroso1222/ama/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22favorite%2Fpopular%2Ffrequently%20asked%22%20) questions. There are also other [labels](https://github.com/caroso1222/ama/labels) to sort the questions by ([work in progress](https://github.com/caroso1222/ama/issues/424)).

I get a lot of questions by email but responding to an email only helps one person. This way anyone can read the answer.

**If you'd rather not ask your question publicly**, send me an [email](mailto:ce.roso398@gmail.com) and I can post the question anonymously for you.

Anything means anything. Personal questions. Money. Life. Code. Whatever.

#### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)
- I will not help you with a question that goes against my personal moral standards.

#### Disclaimer

##### Answers from me

All questions are welcome but not all questions will be answered by me. Some questions may be answered by volunteers helping me. Others may not be answered at all. To increase the likelyhood of me answering your question it should:

- Be relevant to me or my opinions in some way and not something anyone could answer (those are better served by [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), etc).

##### Answer format


#### Other contact mediums

I can also be reached on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/caroso1222) and [email](mailto:ce.roso398@gmail.com), but I prefer [this medium](https://github.com/caroso1222/ama/issues/new).
